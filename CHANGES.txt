1.0b3 - 2010-04-20
------------------

- Properly handle the 'omitted' tagged value when it is set to 'false' for a
  field.

1.0b2 - 2009-07-12
------------------

- Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. process_fields()
  becomes processFields().

  Note in particular that the additional_schemata property is now called 
  additionalSchemata. If you have implemented this property yourself, you will
  need to rename it!
