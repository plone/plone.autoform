Changelog
=========

1.6 (unreleased)
----------------

- Support anonymous schema (dynamic interfaces with and empty
  __name__ attribute) in autoGroups, opting to use prefix as
  group name for such cases.  This allows subclasses of
  AutoExtensibleForm to implement getPrefix() method as
  a sufficient condition to support an unnamed schema.

1.5 (2013-08-14)
----------------

- Added an option on form to allow display of empty fieldsets.
  [thomasdesvenain]

- fix tests
  [vangheem]


1.4 (2013-05-23)
----------------

- Enhance the widget directive to allow for specifying widget parameters
  within the schema.
  [davisagli]

- Support passing widget classes in the widget directive in addition to
  IFieldWidgets.
  [davisagli]

- Support serializing widget parameters to XML. This requires implementing
  a IWidgetExportImportHandler utility for the widget type.
  [davisagli]


1.3 (2012-08-30)
----------------

- Avoid dependency on z3c.form.testing.
  [hannosch]

1.2 (2012-04-15)
----------------

- Moved form schema directives here from plone.directives.form, and
  reimplemented them as plone.supermodel directives to avoid depending on
  grok.  Included directives: omitted, no_omit, mode, widget, order_before,
  order_after, read_permission, write_permission
  [davisagli]

1.1 - 2012-02-20
----------------

- Added the AutoObjectSubForm class to support form hints for
  object widget subforms.
  [jcbrand]

1.0 - 2011-05-13
----------------

- Raise a NotImplementedError instead of NotImplemented as that is not
  an exception but meant for comparisons and is not callable.
  [maurits]


1.0b7 - 2011-04-29
------------------

- Check to make sure that interfaces and field widgets resolved by the
  supermodel handler are of the correct type.
  [elro]

- Add form:validator support for supermodel.
  [elro]

- Fix issue where permission checks were not applied correctly to schemas being
  added with prefixes.
  [davisagli]

  [WouterVH]


1.0b6 - 2011-02-11
------------------

- Fix WidgetsView so that _update and update do not clash.
  [elro]

- Fix view.txt doctest to test actual behaviour, not artifacts from test setup.
  [elro]


1.0b5 - 2011-01-11
------------------

- Use five.ManageSite permission to check field permissions. We'll avoid
  sniffing for Five/CMFCore permissions.zcml difference between Zope 2.12 and
  2.13. [esteele]


1.0b4 - 2010-08-05
------------------

  [optilude]

- Removed some dead code.
  Fixes http://code.google.com/p/dexterity/issues/detail?id=132

1.0b3 - 2010-04-20
------------------

- Properly handle the 'omitted' tagged value when it is set to 'false' for a
  field.
  [davisagli]

- Make it possible to set the 'omitted' and 'mode' settings only for particular
  form interfaces.
  [davisagli]

- Do not omit read-only fields when rendering a form in DISPLAY mode.

  [mj]


1.0b2 - 2009-07-12
------------------

- Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. process_fields()
  becomes processFields().

  Note in particular that the additional_schemata property is now called
  additionalSchemata. If you have implemented this property yourself, you will
  need to rename it!

1.0b1 - 2009-04-17
------------------

- Initial release
