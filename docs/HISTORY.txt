1.0b2 - 2009-07-12
------------------

* Changed API methods and arguments to mixedCase to be more consistent with
  the rest of Zope. This is a non-backwards-compatible change. Our profuse
  apologies, but it's now or never. :-/

  If you find that you get import errors or unknown keyword arguments in your
  code, please change names from foo_bar too fooBar, e.g. process_fields()
  becomes processFields().
  
  Note in particular that the additional_schemata property is now called 
  additionalSchemata. If you have implemented this property yourself, you will
  need to rename it!

1.0b1 - 2009-04-17
